## ✨ **NEW FEATURE: System Status Dashboard**

I've added a **real-time monitoring panel** to your dashboard!

### What You Can See:
- 🟢 **Component Health** - Visual green/red indicators for each system
- 📋 **Recent Logs** - See what the system is doing in real-time
- 🌐 **API Status** - Check if Etherscan/CoinGecko are connected
- 📊 **System Metrics** - Memory usage, uptime, recent activity
- ⏰ **Background Jobs** - When each automated task last ran
- ⚡ **Quick Actions** - Refresh, export logs, clear

### How to Access:
1. Open dashboard: `http://your-server:3005`
2. Click **"📋 View Detailed Tables"**
3. Click **"🔧 System Status"** tab
4. See all components with green/red indicators!

### What "Working" Looks Like:
```
✅ All 4 components showing green pulsing dots

✅ API connections green
✅ Memory under 400MB
✅ Background jobs running on schedule
✅ Recent activity showing transactions/trades
```

## 📊 **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### Immediate (0-10 minutes):
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Sees "Added 30 wallets" or "already has 30 wallets"
- [ ] Dashboard loads at http://your-server:3005
- [ ] System Status tab shows all components green
- [ ] API connections show as connected

### Short Term (10-60 minutes):
- [ ] System Status shows recent tracking timestamps
- [ ] "Last run" times updating every 10 minutes
- [ ] Logs showing tracking activity
- [ ] Transactions appearing (if wallet activity exists)
- [ ] Paper trades executing (if criteria met)

### Medium Term (1-4 hours):
- [ ] Multiple tracking cycles completed
- [ ] Some trades closed with P&L
- [ ] Memory usage stable (200-300MB)
- [ ] Component health still all green
- [ ] Dashboard showing performance metrics

### Long Term (24 hours):
- [ ] System running smoothly
- [ ] No red components
- [ ] Discovery has run (every 6 hours)
- [ ] Performance data accumulating
- [ ] No crashes or errors

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (Production Mode)**

### Activity Levels:

**High Activity Day:**
- 50-200 transactions tracked
- 10-30 paper trades executed
- Multiple position exits
- Lots of green log entries

**Low Activity Day:**
- 5-20 transactions tracked
- 1-5 paper trades executed
- Few position changes
- System healthy but quiet

**No Activity Day:**
- 0 transactions
- 0 trades
- All components still green
- **This is NORMAL!** Wallets don't trade every day

### What's Normal:
- ✅ Days with no wallet activity
- ✅ Tracking running but finding 0 transactions
- ✅ Strategies rejecting most trades (they're selective)
- ✅ Discovery running every 6 hours
- ✅ Component health staying green

### What's NOT Normal:
- 🔴 Red components for > 1 hour
- 🔴 Memory growing continuously
- 🔴 Tracking not running (Last: Never after 30 min)
- 🔴 All components offline

## 🆘 **TROUBLESHOOTING WITH STATUS PANEL**

### Problem: System seems dead

**Check System Status Tab:**
1. **All red?** → Server crashed, restart needed
2. **All green but "Never"?** → Just started, wait 10 min
3. **All green but 0 activity?** → Wallets not trading (NORMAL)
4. **Red database?** → Database file corrupted, restore backup

### Problem: No trades being executed

**Check System Status Tab:**
1. **Paper Trading Engine green?** → Component working
2. **Processed count increasing?** → Transactions being evaluated
3. **Check logs for rejection reasons:**
   - "Trade size below threshold" → Prices not fetching
   - "Wallet win rate too low" → Strategy criteria not met
   - "Max concurrent trades" → At capacity (good!)

### Problem: High memory usage

**Check System Metrics:**
- Memory > 80% → Should trigger cleanup automatically
- If memory keeps growing → Bug in code (shouldn't happen with fixes)
- If stable but high → Normal for large transaction history
