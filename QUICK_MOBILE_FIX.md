# Quick Mobile Access Fix

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ Changed hardcoded `localhost:3005` to auto-detect your IP
2. ✅ Server now accepts connections from mobile devices (binds to 0.0.0.0)
3. ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile automatically
4. ✅ Port 3005 configured correctly

## Quick Steps to Use

### 1. Restart Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

### 2. Find Your Computer's IP
```powershell
ipconfig
```
Look for IPv4 Address (e.g., `192.168.1.45`)

### 3. Clear Mobile Browser Cache
- iPhone: Settings → Safari → Clear History
- Android: Chrome → History → Clear browsing data
- OR use Private/Incognito mode

### 4. Access from Mobile
```
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3005
```
Example: `http://192.168.1.45:3005`

## Expected Results

- ✅ No more connection errors
- ✅ Shows 31 wallets (same as desktop)  
- ✅ Dashboard refreshes normally
- ✅ All features work
