---

## üìä Configuration Summary

### Strategy Thresholds (BALANCED)

| Strategy | Min Trade | Win Rate Req | Max Position | Max Concurrent | Stop Loss |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **CopyTrade** | $50 | 50% | $200 | 15 | 12% |
| **VolumeBreakout** | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | $150 | 10 | 15% |
| **SmartMoney** | $2,000 | ‚Äî | $250 | 8 | 10% |
| **Arbitrage** | $250 | 50% | $200 | 8 | 8% |
| **Memecoin** | ‚Äî | 35% | $100 | 12 | 40% |
| **EarlyGem** | ‚Äî | 50% | $75 | 6 | 25% |

**Key Changes from Test Mode:**
- ‚úÖ Minimum trade sizes increased (was $10-100, now $50-2000)
- ‚úÖ Win rate requirements increased (was 25-40%, now 35-50%)
- ‚úÖ Max concurrent trades reduced (better risk control)
- ‚úÖ Position sizes reduced by 20-33%
- ‚úÖ Stop losses tightened by 20-40%

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management (ACTIVE PROTECTION)

### Automatic Trading Pauses

The system will **automatically pause all trading** if:

1. **Drawdown > 20%** - System pauses until manually reviewed
2. **Daily Loss > 3%** - No new trades for 24 hours
3. **Weekly Loss > 8%** - No new trades for 7 days
4. **Open Positions ‚â• 40** - No new trades until some close
5. **Individual Wallet Down 12%** - Wallet paused automatically
6. **Strategy Down 15%** - Strategy paused automatically

**These are HARD LIMITS that protect your capital while you're away.**

---

### Risk Limits Summary

| Limit Type | Threshold | Action | Recovery |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Max Drawdown** | 20% | Pause all trading | Manual review required |
| **Daily Loss** | 3% of capital | Pause for 24h | Auto-resumes next day |
| **Weekly Loss** | 8% of capital | Pause for 7 days | Auto-resumes after 7 days |
| **Position Size** | 12% of capital | Reject trade | Automatic |
| **Open Positions** | 40 total | Reject new trades | Automatic when <40 |
| **Correlation** | 25% max | Reject correlated | Automatic |

---

### Position Management

**Conservative Sizing:**
- Each trade limited to 12% of capital (was 15%)
- Copy only 8% of original trade size (was 10%)
- Maximum 40 open positions across all strategies

**Tighter Stops:**
- CopyTrade: 12% stop loss (was 15%)
- SmartMoney: 10% stop loss (unchanged - already tight)
- Arbitrage: 8% stop loss (unchanged - already tight)
- Memecoin: 40% stop loss (was 50%)
- EarlyGem: 25% stop loss (was 30%)

**Earlier Profit Taking:**
- CopyTrade: Take profit at 40% (was 50%)
- VolumeBreakout: Take profit at 60% (was 75%)
- SmartMoney: Take profit at 35% (was 40%)
- Arbitrage: Take profit at 20% (was 25%)

---

## üîç Discovery Settings (BALANCED)

**Conservative Discovery:**
- Daily limit: **15 wallets/day** (was 25)
- Min trade history: **15 trades** (was 10)
- Min win rate: **55%** (was 52%)
- Min profitability: **$3,000** (was $2,000)
- Pump threshold: **2.5x** (was 2x)
- Timeframe: **10 days** (was 14)

**Result:** Discovery will be more selective, only adding high-quality wallets.

## üîî Monitoring & Alerts

### What to Check Daily (5 minutes)

```bash
# Quick status check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard | jq '{
  totalTrades: .performance.totalTrades,
  winRate: .performance.winRate,
  currentPnL: .performance.totalPnl,
  openTrades: .openTrades | length
}'
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "totalTrades": 45,
  "winRate": 0.48,
  "currentPnL": -125.50,
  "openTrades": 12
}
```

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Win rate <40% for 7+ days
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Open trades >35
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PnL down >15%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No trades executed in 24h (may indicate issue)

---

### What to Check Weekly (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Strategy breakdown
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard | jq '.strategyBreakdown'

# 2. Wallet activity
curl http://localhost:3000/api/wallets/activity | jq '.summary'

# 3. Risk status (if you add endpoint later)
# curl http://localhost:3000/api/risk/status

# 4. Check logs for errors
tail -100 logs/error-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
```

**Actions to Take:**
- Disable strategies with win rate <35% after 20+ trades
- Remove wallets with 0 activity for 14+ days
- Promote high-performing discovered wallets
- Tighten thresholds on profitable strategies

---

### Setting Up Email/SMS Alerts (Optional)

Create a monitoring script `monitor.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if system is still running
if ! pm2 status | grep -q "online"; then
  # Send alert (configure your email/SMS service)
  echo "MoneyMachine is DOWN!" | mail -s "ALERT" your@email.com
fi

# Check for significant loss
CURRENT_PNL=$(curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard | jq '.performance.totalPnl')
if [ $(echo "$CURRENT_PNL < -1000" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "MoneyMachine PnL is below -$1000: $CURRENT_PNL" | mail -s "ALERT" your@email.com
fi
```

Schedule with cron:
```bash
crontab -e
# Add:
0 */6 * * * /path/to/monitor.sh  # Check every 6 hours
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Tasks

---

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### System is Down
```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View recent logs
pm2 logs --lines 50

# Restart
pm2 restart moneymachine

# If that fails, stop and start fresh
pm2 delete moneymachine
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Too Many Losses
```bash
# Option 1: Enable emergency stop (pauses all trading)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/emergency-stop

# Option 2: Stop the system entirely
pm2 stop moneymachine

# Option 3: Lower position sizes in config.js
# Edit: maxPerTrade values (reduce by 50%)
# Then restart: pm2 restart moneymachine
```

### Running Out of Capital
The system automatically stops when:
- Available capital < $500
- Can't meet minimum position sizes

**Recovery:**
1. Close unprofitable positions manually
2. Reduce maxPerTrade in config.js
3. Pause riskiest strategies (memecoin, earlyGem)

## üîß Tuning After Data Collection

Once you have 100+ closed trades (2-4 weeks), analyze and tune:

### Identify Winners
```bash
# Check strategy performance
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard | jq '.strategyBreakdown | 
  to_entries | 
  sort_by(.value.winRate) | 
  reverse'
```

### Optimization Path

**For Profitable Strategies (>50% win rate):**
1. Increase allocation by 20-30%
2. Gradually tighten entry requirements
3. Optimize take-profit levels
4. Increase max concurrent trades

**For Break-Even Strategies (45-50% win rate):**
1. Keep current settings
2. Continue monitoring
3. Small tweaks to improve edge

**For Losing Strategies (<45% win rate):**
1. Reduce allocation by 50%
2. Tighten entry requirements significantly
3. Consider pausing if <40% after 50+ trades

## üí° Best Practices for Unsupervised Operation

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Check system health every 1-3 days
- Review performance weekly
- Keep database backups
- Monitor for errors in logs
- Trust the risk management system
- Let strategies run long enough to collect data (50+ trades minimum)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Constantly adjust parameters (let data accumulate)
- Panic on temporary drawdowns (<10%)
- Disable risk limits "just to see"
- Add too many wallets too quickly
- Chase losses by increasing position sizes
- Disable strategies with <20 trades

---
