## How To Deploy

### 1. **Restart Your Server**
```bash
# Stop current server
pm2 stop all  # or Ctrl+C

# Clear old logs
rm logs/*.log

# Restart
npm start

# Or with PM2
pm2 restart all
pm2 logs
```

### 2. **Watch The Logs**
You'll now see detailed output:
```
üîÑ Processing 255 transactions...
  ‚úÖ TRADE EXECUTED: BONK via copyTrade - Mirroring...
  ‚úÖ TRADE EXECUTED: WIF via volumeBreakout - Volume breakout: 4.2x normal...
  
üìä Processing Summary:
  ‚úÖ Trades Executed: 12
  ‚ùå Trades Rejected: 243
  
  Top Rejection Reasons:
    ‚Ä¢ copyTrade: Trade too small ($45 < $100): 87x
    ‚Ä¢ smartMoney: Trade too small ($450 < $5000): 64x
    ‚Ä¢ volumeBreakout: Normal volume (2 buyers, 1.3x): 42x
```

## What To Expect

### **First Hour:**
- System will process your 255 existing transactions
- Should execute 10-30 trades (depending on their characteristics)
- You'll see rejection reasons for ones that don't match

### **After 10 Minutes (Next Tracking Cycle):**
- New transactions detected
- More trades executed
- Open positions start being managed

### **First 24 Hours:**
- 50-150 trades total
- Clear strategy performance comparison
- Some positions will hit stop loss/take profit

---

## Strategy Priority Order

Trades are evaluated in this order (first match wins):

1. **CopyTrade** - Catches most trades (55%+ WR, $100+)
2. **SmartMoney** - Whale trades only ($5k+)
3. **VolumeBreakout** - Volume spikes (3x+ normal)
4. **Memecoin** - Solana tokens
5. **Arbitrage** - Ethereum DeFi  
6. **EarlyGem** - New tokens on Base/Arbitrum

This ensures maximum trade capture while maintaining quality.

---

## Monitoring

### **Check Dashboard:**
- Should see trades appearing
- Strategy breakdown should show data for multiple strategies
- Open positions should have active P&L

### **Check Logs:**
```bash
tail -f logs/tracker-*.log
```

Look for:
- `‚úÖ TRADE EXECUTED` - Good!
- `Top Rejection Reasons` - Understand why trades were skipped
- Error messages - Report any unexpected errors

---

## If No Trades After 1 Hour

### **Diagnosis:**
1. Check if transactions are being detected:
   - Dashboard should show "255 transactions" increasing
   - If stuck at 255, check RPC connections

2. Check rejection reasons in logs:
   - If all say "Trade too small", your wallets trade below thresholds
   - If all say "Wallet not active", check wallet status in DB

3. Manual test:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3005/api/track -X POST
```
This forces a tracking cycle immediately.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor for 24 hours** - Let it run and collect data
2. **Review performance** - See which strategies work best
3. **Adjust if needed** - Can lower thresholds further if no trades
4. **Scale up** - Once proven, increase allocations

## Need Help?

Check logs first:
```bash
cat logs/tracker-*.log | grep "TRADE EXECUTED"
cat logs/tracker-*.log | grep "Top Rejection Reasons" | tail -5
```

This shows what's working and what's being filtered out.
