# 🔧 Fixed: 429 Too Many Requests Errors

## Problem Identified

You were getting two types of 429 errors:

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Blockchain RPC Rate Limits
- **Source**: Solana public RPC endpoints
- **Cause**: Too many API calls too quickly
- **Fix**: Increased delays between wallet checks (2s → 5s) and transaction fetches

### 2. ✅ FIXED: API Server Rate Limits (This Issue)
- **Source**: Your own Express server
- **Cause**: Rate limiter blocking frontend dashboard requests
- **Details**: Dashboard makes 4 API calls every 30 seconds, exceeding the 100 requests per 15 minutes limit

---

## What Was Fixed

### Backend: Rate Limiting (`backend/middleware/security.js`)

**Before:**
- All requests rate limited: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Your dashboard hit this limit in ~7.5 minutes

**After:**
- ✅ **Localhost exempted** from rate limiting
- Unlimited requests from `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or `::ffff:127.0.0.1`
- Rate limits still apply to external IPs (security maintained)
- Discovery limit increased: 5 → 20 runs per hour

### Frontend: Error Handling (`frontend/dashboard.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
const perf = dashboardData.performance;
const currentValue = perf.currentCapital || 10000; // ❌ Crashes if performance is undefined
```

**After:**
```javascript
const perf = dashboardData.performance || {}; // ✅ Safe fallback
const currentValue = perf.currentCapital || 10000;
```

Also fixed `allTrades.filter()` error by checking if it's an array first.

## 🚀 How to Apply Fixes

### 1. Restart Your Server
```powershell
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in your PowerShell)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
```
In Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
Or: F12 → Network tab → "Disable cache" checkbox
```

### 3. Test the Dashboard
- Go to: 
http://localhost:3000
- Dashboard should load without errors
- Check browser console (F12) - no more 429 errors!

---

## ✅ Expected Results

### Before:
```
❌ api/dashboard:1  Failed to load resource: 429 (Too Many Requests)
❌ api/wallets:1  Failed to load resource: 429 (Too Many Requests)
❌ api/trades?limit=100:1  Failed to load resource: 429 (Too Many Requests)
❌ api/discovered?promoted=false:1  Failed to load resource: 429 (Too Many Requests)
❌ Error loading data: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
```

### After:
```
✅ All API requests return 200 OK
✅ Dashboard loads properly
✅ No JavaScript errors
✅ Real-time updates every 30 seconds
```

---

## 🛡️ Security Note

**Rate limiting is STILL ACTIVE for external IPs!**

- ✅ External requests: 100 per 15 minutes (protected)
- ✅ Localhost requests: Unlimited (for development)
- ✅ Production deployments: Add firewall rules to restrict external access

If you deploy this to a public server, make sure to:
1. Set up proper authentication (API keys)
2. Use a reverse proxy (nginx)
3. Configure firewall to only allow trusted IPs

## 📊 Rate Limit Summary

| Endpoint Type | External IPs | Localhost |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **General API** | 100 per 15 min | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Expensive Ops** | 10 per 15 min | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Discovery** | 20 per hour | ✅ Unlimited |

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Restart server (required)
2. ✅ Test dashboard at http://localhost:3000
3. ✅ Check browser console for errors (should be clean)
4. ✅ Try running discovery manually (should work unlimited times)
5. ✅ Monitor the next 10-minute tracking cycle (should complete without errors)

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Server Logs
You should see clean logs like:
```json
{"level":"info","message":"HTTP Request","method":"GET","statusCode":200,"url":"/api/dashboard"}
{"level":"info","message":"HTTP Request","method":"GET","statusCode":200,"url":"/api/wallets"}
```

No more 429 errors!

### Check Browser Console
Open F12 → Console tab. Should be clean with no errors.

### Check Network Tab
Open F12 → Network tab. All API requests should return:
- Status: `200 OK` (not 429)
- Response time: < 100ms

---

## 💡 Why This Happened

Your dashboard polls the API every 30 seconds with 4 requests:
1. `/api/dashboard`
2. `/api/wallets`
3. `/api/trades?limit=100`
4. `/api/discovered?promoted=false`

**Math:**
- 4 requests × 2 times/minute = 8 requests/minute
- 8 × 15 minutes = **120 requests** in the rate limit window
- Rate limit was 100 → **you exceeded it!**

Now localhost is exempted, so no more issues! 🎉

---

## If You Still See Errors...

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check you restarted the server** (logs should show fresh startup)
3. **Verify localhost IP** - your IP should be `::1` in the logs
4. **Check for typos** - make sure the files were saved correctly

If problems persist, let me know!
